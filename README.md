#Perfect Holiday Destination

Once I had a dream - a crazy one. I was dreaming about an amusing website which can interact with a user. I thought it could be a reasonable idea to make one as a final project for Coders Lab. Ha ha..well I did so..

But as you may know I didn't have any experience in making web sites while creating this one... so let's just treat it as 'licentia poetica'. Don't think, don't ask yourself question - but..why? Just let it be... 

The project covers HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Java Script, jQuery, RWD and Bootstrap.
